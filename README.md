College Football Scraping Setup
=====

A set of R scripts that scrape college football data from cfbdatawarehouse.com and wikipedia.org.  All division I-A and I-AA teams are included.  The data includes:
* Game by game records
* Bowl game records
* Conference and Division Affiliations
* Year end polls for all time
* Yearly coach records
* Current coaches coaching and playing background
* Rivals recruiting rankings

Potential Questions
=====

* Predict whether a team will be bowl eligible for the next season
* Is recruiting ranking (number of _k_-star recruits) predictive of success?
* Is it primarily the  school or head coach that predicts the quality of recruits?


Final Data - Feb 20, 2013
=====
Current version of the final data can be found within the directory: **Data/Final/cfbData-Feb2013.Rdata**.  This can be loaded with *load("cfbData-Feb2013.Rdata")* from within the directory.  The data is stored in the object **cfbData** or you can use the command *ls()* to see all the objects currently loaded within *R*.
